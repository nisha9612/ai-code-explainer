# Summary

This project is an AI-powered code understanding tool that analyzes source code, parses its structure into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and generates accurate natural-language explanations using an LLM. The system is built with a lightweight PHP backend and a Node.js CLI. The CLI collects the user’s code, automatically generates an AST (using Esprima for JavaScript), and sends both the raw code and structural metadata to the backend. The PHP backend validates the request, loads environment variables, and sends a well-constructed prompt containing both code and AST to an AI model such as OpenAI, or Mistral.

This architecture cleanly separates responsibilities: parsing happens in the CLI, routing and request handling occur in PHP, and AI logic is encapsulated inside service classes. Passing AST to the LLM significantly improves explanation accuracy because the model receives formal syntax structure instead of only raw code. The system is easily extensible — additional languages, diff view, complexity analysis, and web UI can be added without changing core logic. Overall, this solution demonstrates strong engineering practices: modularity, multi-language parsing, LLM integration, and clean API design.
